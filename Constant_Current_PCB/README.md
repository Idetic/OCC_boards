# Constant Current PCB

This PCB design functions as a constant current circuit, driving an LED with high accuracy. The input of the board requires a voltage source. Depending on the chosen resistance values, this circuit can drive an LED with a wide range of intensity levels.


## Parameters

The input of the Circuit is a Voltage and the output is a current level. The parameters of the circuit are the following:

1. $R_{sense}$: The current over this resistance is "copied" at the LED. 
2. $R_{div}$: This is a voltage divisor for conditioning the input voltage.
